    <p id="p1">CSS colors are used to set the color of different parts of a webpage, like text, background, and borders. <br>
        <p id="p2">This helps make the page look more attractive and easier to read.</p>
        <P id="p3">We can define colors using names, hex codes, RGB values, and more.</P>


<!-- RGB Color Scheme:  
It is a three-channel format containing data for red, green, and blue colors.
In CSS the RGB color format can be specified using: rgb(red, green, blue).
Each parameter in rgb() function defines the intensity of colors in a range of 0 to 255. 
The value 0 defines no color of that type being used while 255 defines the highest value of that color being used.
The opacity of the color cannot be specified using this color format.
Example: The rgb(0, 0, 255) defines blue color as its value is set to highest(255), while others are set as 0.

RGBA Color Scheme: The RGBA color format is an extension of the RGB scheme with an added alpha channel that specifies the opacity of the color. 
In CSS, the RGBA color format can be specified using:  rgba(red, green, blue, alpha).
The opacity of the color can be easily controlled by specifying the opacity in terms of a parameter.
Example: The rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3) defines the red color with opacity set to 0.3.
